    <div class="intro">
        During summer of 2015 I had some free time and decided I was going to rebuild my website.  My old site was thrown together in about four days from bootstrap templates and I built it when I had only a very basic working knowledge of HTML/CSS and no JavaScript experience.  I remember going back to it after a semester and not even wanting to work on it/make it better because the code was so bad.  Thus, I decided to create this site!

    <div class="specifics">
        <div class="subsubtitle">Page Animations</div>
        <div class="description">I didn't want a single page scroller like my old website.  At the same time, I wanted to learn how to animate page transitions, so I decided to go with pages that would slide up and slide down when opened/closed.</div>
        <div class="animate-example card-border"></div>
        <div class="subsubtitle">Content</div>
        <div class="description">Was Angular necessary?  No, I'm aware that for a personal web page like mine it wasn't, but this was more of a learning experience for me.  I made this website (1) for myself because I wanted to familiarize myself with the MVC model and get better at web design (2) for others to look at projects I've done and what I can do.  I also wanted something that people would look at and say, "this feels very you."  I'm proud to present the finished product, so I hope you enjoy it!</div>
