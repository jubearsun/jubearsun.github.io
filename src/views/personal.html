    <div class="intro">
        During summer of 2015 I had some free time and decided I was going to rebuild my website.  My old site was thrown together in about four days from bootstrap templates and I built it when I had only a very basic working knowledge of HTML/CSS and no JavaScript experience.  I remember going back to it after a semester and not even wanting to work on it/make it better because the code was so bad.  Thus, I decided to create this site!

    <div class="specifics">
        <div class="subsubtitle">Page Animations</div>
        <div class="description">I didn't want a single page scroller like my old website.  At the same time, I wanted to learn how to animate page transitions, so I decided to go with pages that would slide up and slide down when opened/closed.</div>
        <div class="animate-example card-border"></div>
        <div class="subsubtitle">Content</div>
        <div class="description">I made this website (1) for myself because I wanted to familiarize myself with the MVC model and get better at web design (2) to showcase to others what I can do.  I wanted something that people would look at and say, "this feels very you."  I made sure to include quirks about me in my bio so visitors get a sense of who I am as a person, and design pages that are simple yet fun to exemplify what I can do as a growing developer.  I'm proud to present the finished product, so I hope you enjoy it!</div>

    <ul class="takeaways">
        <li>Page animations...why didn't I try them earlier?</li>
        <li>Drawing arrows and x's is perplexing</li>
        <li>But making things yourself is actually really fun</li>
        <li>Never going back to bootstrap</li>
    </ul>
